# London Bike Sharing

This repository documents an end-to-end data analysis project, covering the entire data analysis lifecycle from data gathering to interactive data visualization.

## Project Overview

In this project, I performed the following key tasks:

1. **Data Gathering:** Obtained the dataset from Kaggle <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hmavrodiev/london-bike-sharing-dataset>.

2. **Data Exploration:** Conducted an initial exploration of the dataset to gain insights into its structure and contents. 

3. **Data Manipulation:** Utilized the pandas library in Python to clean, transform, and preprocess the data.

4. **Interactive Data Visualization:** Leveraged Tableau to create interactive and insightful data visualizations. These visualizations were designed to communicate the key findings and insights derived from the data.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `london_merged.csv`: This directory contains the dataset used in the project.

- `london_bikes_final.xlsx`: This directory contains the final dataframe written in an Excel file.
  
- `london_bike_sharing.py`: Here, you'll find the code (PyCharm code editor) that documents the data exploration and data manipulation processes using Python's pandas library.

- `London Bike Sharing`: This directory holds the Tableau workbook and dashboards used to create interactive data visualizations.
